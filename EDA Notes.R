#First Principle: Show some form of comparison
#the evidence for a hypothesis is
#always relative to another competing or alternative hypothesis.
# When presented with a claim that something is good, you should always ask "Compared to
# What?" 

# Second principle: Show
# causality or a mechanism of how your theory of the data works. This explanation or
# systematic structure shows your causal framework for thinking about the question you're
# trying to answer.

# Third principle: Show Multivariate data.
# What is multivariate data you might ask? In technical (scientific) literature this 
# term means more than 2 variables. Two-variable plots are what you saw in high school
# algebra.  Remember those x,y plots when you were learning about slopes and intercepts
# and equations of lines? They're valuable, but usually questions are more complicated
# and require more variables.

#  Sometimes, if you restrict yourself to two variables you'll be misled and draw an
# incorrect conclusion.

# Simpson's paradox, or the Yuleâ€“Simpson effect. Wikipedia
#| (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) tells us that this "is a paradox in
#| probability and statistics, in which a trend that appears in different groups of data
#| disappears when these groups are combined."

# The Fourth Principle: Integrating Evidence. Don't limit yoursef to one form of
# expression. Use words, numbers, images as well as diagrams.
# "Don't let the tool drive the analysis".

# The Fifth Principle: Describe and document the evidence with sources and
# appropriate labels and scales.
# (also, using R, preserve any code used to generate your data and graphics so
# that the research can be replicated.)

# The Sixth Principle: Content is King!
# If you don't have something interesting to report, your graphs won't save you.
# Analytic presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, 
# relevance and integrity of their content.

# Exploratory Graphs:  Exploratory graphs serve mostly the same functions as graphs. 
# They help us find patterns in data and understand its properties. 
# They suggest modeling strategies and help to debug analyses. 
# We DON'T use exploratory graphs to communicate results.

# Instead, exploratory graphs are the initial step in an investigation, the "quick and
# dirty" tool used to point the data scientist in a fruitful direction. A scientist might
# need to make a lot of exploratory graphs in order to develop a personal understanding
# of the problem being studied. Plot details such as axes, legends, color and size are 
# cleaned up later to convey more information in an aesthetically pleasing way.
